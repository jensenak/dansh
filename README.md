DanSH
-----

Dan Shell is a simple python shell aimed at teaching my son (Dan) the basics of command line interactions. It really doesn't do much right now, but the idea is for it to have some very limited (but common) commands that can only be run inside of the user's home directory.

The current version expects the simple text editor "micro" to be installed at /usr/local/bin/micro.
